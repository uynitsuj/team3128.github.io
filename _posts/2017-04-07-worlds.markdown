With the final regionals wrapping up this week, we thought we'd update you on how we did this competition season. Our most recent regional was the [Sacramento Regional](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2017cada), where we faced off with some of the best teams in the FIRST Robotics Competition. We entered the quarterfinals elimination matches pitted against team [1678, the Citrus Circuits](https://modmealsonmendenhall.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/lemon1.jpg), and we could not quite face off with the team that ended up winning the entire competition.

But our real shining moment occurred right at home at the [San Diego Regional](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2017casd). Entering eliminations, we were the worst off team. Being last-seeded alliance, we were up against FIRST Hall of Fame Team 1539, the Holy Cows. That being said, with our alliance partners [5199, the Robot Dolphins from Outer Space](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5199), and [2637, the Phantom Catz](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2637), we pulled off a huge upset, beating the first seeded alliance and moving on to semifinals. We breezed through semifinals, and were narrowly defeated (by a two point margin) by the second seeded alliance, led by our friends over at San Dieguito Academy, [Team 2102 - Team Paradox](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2102/). However, since our team was the picking team of our alliance, we were granted a spot in the Houston World Championships from April 19th to April 22nd. We could not be happier, as we have never performed better, and we are extremely excited for the championship.

As for our amazing alliance partners from San Diego, both the Dolphins and the Catz are competing in the [Las Vegas Regional](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2017nvlv). Join us in wishing them the best of luck, and we hope to see them in Houston!

As for us, you can closely follow the Houston championships on [the Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2017cmptx). We don't have very much information about where we'll be, but stay tuned for more information!
