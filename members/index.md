Becoming a part of robotics is very easy. There are just a few steps:

1. Sign up on our team roster. This will get you added to our mailing list so you know everything that is going on.
2. Sign up on [STIMS](https://my.usfirst.org/stims/Login.aspx), our league information manager. This will let you attend tournaments and be involved in official robotics events off-campus. This step requires a parental unit to finish.
3. Show up! We meet at the Robotics Workshop that is located right under the Learning Commons and just past the Nest. It's somewhat hard to miss, with the robots, the stacks of wood, and all of us. You can check out our [calendar](/students/calendar/) and [blog updates](/blog/) to find out about all the things happening in robotics. You can also [email our leaders](/contact/) to ask any questions you may have.
4. Like us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/aluminumnarwhals). Announcements, photos, and all sorts of awesome stuff will go out through there as well.
5. [Join GitHub.](/students/github/) GitHub is the place where all team information, discussion, and collaboration will occur in the future. Any information that the team needs to know can be found on our organization's GitHub, as well as new projects and code. **Useful member information is posted on the [info repository](https://github.com/Team3128/info/wiki) on the team's GitHub account**

## Growing Your Skills

After you’ve signed up, there are lots of different ways to grow your skills:

+ **Learn your way around the workshop.** Through various talks and hands-on explanations, mentors and students explain how to use various tools and the various procedures of the team.
+ **Attend Workshops and Classes,** Throughout preseason, our members and mentors will be giving lessons and working with new members to help them learn more and be ready for build season.
+ **Be Involved.** Often, the best learning experience comes with jumping right into it. With the guidance of more experienced mentors and members, pursue projects and participate in what interests you.

If you have any scheduling/team questions, you can also check out our [Frequently Asked Questions](/parents/faq/) page.

## Workshop Hours

Tracking the time you spend at the workshop is important. Not only is having record of all your hard work and dedication a great college application point, but privileges like slots on our leadership team, competition team, or travel team all require certain minimum hour requirements. Here’s how to get started:

+ When you come to the workshop each day, find the Workshop Supervisor and sign in electronically with your Student ID card. You’ll need to talk to them again to sign out.
+ If you forgot/don’t have your Student ID card, fill out our [time log worksheet](/assets//documents/FRC_Time_Log_Workshop.pdf). You can also use this sheet if you remember you forgot to sign in with the Workshop Supervisor.

## Team Leadership

Our team is led by a group of elected officials and appointed officers.

They meet during weekly Leadership meeting where the leadership, mentors, and project leaders discuss the current happenings of the team.

### Elected Positions

Our President is elected at the end of every year in May by a team vote. Anyone who has been on the team for at least one complete build season can self-nominate for President or Vice President. The Vice President may nominate themselves to the Presidential candidates, and President-Vice President tickets will run in the election. The election will follow each Presidential candidate delivering opening and closing statements before and after responses to specific questions submitted by team members and chosen by mentors.
