# Tool Certification

In order to use the tools in the Robotics Workshop, we require that each student go through a tool workshop led by a mentor to teach them how to safely use our tools. During the session, we will go through all the basic tools you might be expected to use during the year and how to use them properly and safely:

+ Measuring Tape, Calipers, etc.
+ Drills & Drill Bits
+ Circular Saw
+ Jig Saw
+ Chop Saw
+ Workshop Materials Storage

Note: This list is incomplete and may be altered.

## Becoming Certified
To become certified, talk to a mentor to find out when the next time you can go through the tool workshop. At the beginning and end of the year is a great time to get certified, but workshops will also be offered during the year.

Once you’ve gotten through the workshop (usually about 45 – 60 minutes), a mentor will place a sticker on your student ID card and initial it to verify that you’ve complete the certification process.

**After you’re certified** you must present your old student ID badge with certification sticker in place at the beginning of the year to gain the certification sticker for the following year. You will also be briefed on the new tools and safety procedures that you might have not learned yet.

## What do I need to get certified for?
In order to use the tools in our workshop, you must be tool certified. Using power tools in our workshop without being certified will result in removal from the workshop.

You also must be tool certified if you wish to be considered for the following positions:

+ Head of Mechanical
+ Pit Master or Pit Mechanic
+ Project Lead for any project relating to a build-oriented project
