  stats: true
  dimensions: 34.5" W x 31.25" L x 24" H
  weight: 95 lbs
  speed: 9.5 mph
  description: With our 2017 robot, we wanted to build a robot that excelled at the key elements of the game. Throughout numerous revisions and designs, we settled on Ferb. Ferb had a reliable scaling mechansim that efficently and effectively hooked on to the rope and scaled in just under 5 seconds. Ferb also sported an active gear mechanism that allowed for gear intake from both the loading zone and the ground, allowing us to ensure that all gears that ended up by the airship made it on. Ferb was sturdy and reliable and ended up allowing our team to become the Finalist Alliance Captain at the San Diego Regional, securing our spot at the FRC World Championship in Houston.

  description: In order to remain competitive in the 2016 game, we designed a robot that would be fast and efficient at crossing defenses and scoring in the low goal. Topping off at 10 mph, Kiera Knightly excelled at crossing defenses and scoring for our alliance. Aditionally, Knightly was designed to withstand extreme collisions, being a sturdy machine that weighed just under 100 pounds.

  game: Aerial Assist
  name: Sebasitian
  description: This robot was our most impressive yet. With a high-powered three-wheeled swerve drive and a circular base, this robot drove circles around its opponents. Due to the lack of straight edges, it was literally impossible to pin against the wall. Sebastian won us the Xerox Creativity Award at the San Diego Regional.

  game: Rebound Rumble
  name: Asimov
  description: In honor of the great science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, we named our robot the Asimov. One unique feature of Asimov was its pneumatic catapult which allowed us to consistently hit our target while angled extremely high. This way, there was no interference with other basketballs in the air. Aditionally, our robot outmaneuvered other robots with a swerve drive system and picked balls off the ground in order to keep our robot scoring throughout the entire match.

  description: One of the key features that place our robot above the competition was our robots modular electronics box designed to be easily removed from the robot to make electronic repairs easier and more streamlined. Our goals for the Ultra Mega Awesome Robot were to score on all three levels, swiftly deploy a mini bot to the pole during the end game, outmaneuver the competition using our Mecanum wheels, and lift tubes off the ground that have been thrown by our human player.

  game: Breakaway
  name: Fezzik
  description: As our first robot, we wanted to make a four-wheel arcade drive robot that could elevate itself from the tower bar with a scissor lift, elevate two other robots at the same time, lift 500 pounds on each of the side wings, and move in all possible ways during both teleop and autonomous. It is able to push soccuer balls with its bumpers, withstand impacts, and make itself upright after falling over.
