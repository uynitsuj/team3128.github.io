  description: For us, being a FIRST team has always been so much more than just building a robot in six weeks. Ever since our inception, we have always had our eyes on the big picture, and it really has been rewarding. Over the years, we have been able to bring diverse groups of people to do amazing things, and we now have not only subteams dedicated to engineering, but ones that focus on the business and outreach sides. It’s always been extremely important to us, the idea that a FRC team should seek not only to win competitions, but also to get involved in their communities in unexpected ways, invite as many members with varying outlooks sand opinions to join the conversation, and to function as a heterogeneous yet integrated organization of students and mentors doing fantastic things. <br><br> And that’s where branding comes in. How you appear is really just as important as what you do. This truth has always been evident to us, but never really been acted upon. Branding does not draw away from the main functions of an organization; it’s quite the contrary, actually. Having a coherent approach to digital and print media restores focus to the core message that the material seeks to convey. Branding also indisputably creates a sense of unity and purpose amongst those who work with it. Therefore, we found it necessary to create a set of branding guidelines.
